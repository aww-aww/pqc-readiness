## Guidance
* **Hybrid Mode Requirement:** Currently, pure PQC deployments in production data planes are highly discouraged by standards bodies. All "Ready" statuses for IPsec/TLS refer to the implementation of **hybrid key exchanges** (e.g., X25519 + ML-KEM-768) via RFCs 9370, 9242, and 8784.
* **Algorithm Specificity:** Where possible, list the exact parameter set (e.g., ML-KEM-768 vs KyberDraft) as browser support is rapidly shifting (e.g., Chrome 138 explicitly dropped Kyber for FIPS 203 ML-KEM).
